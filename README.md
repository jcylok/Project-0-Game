# Project-0-Game
The reason to make it:

I wanted to create a game that could help user to reduce stress. The first version of this game does not have a timer, so users can play the game as long as it's not over. The game tests a user's response.

User stories :

At the main menu, users have two options: single player or double players. They can either play in single mode or double mode. When they click on "One player", spaceship choices would pop up. Users can hover over the spaceship to make their choice. The play button only show up when the user has clicked on any of the spaceship images. For double player mode, the play button only show up when both users have made their choices. The game start immediately when the play button is clicked. Users need to avoid the enemies falling randomly from the top. They earn points by hitting the enemies and collect coins from the hit objects. A astronaut willy fly from the the bottom whenever player has one life left. User can collect it to heal. They can see the lives and scores instantly at the corner. 

Explanations of the technologies used:

I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and jQuery to build the game web page.The game's structure was created inside canvas. 

The approach taken:

The movement of the objects are stored in arrays. The initial coordinates of some objects are fixed, while some are determined by the interaction among them. The game function is a looping function in which the canvas frame keeps getting refreshed.  

Installation instructions:

Internet is needed to run the jQuery script.

Unsolved problems:

Game level and timer.
